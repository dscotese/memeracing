<li><h3>What's a meme?</h3>
    A meme is like a gene because it gets reproduced and during reproduction it gets modified,
    sometimes getting better and sometimes worse.  It's an idea or concept.</li>
<li><h3>What is a meme race?</h3>
    Here at the MemeRacing site, a meme race is an initial inspirational prompt and all the
    responses that are recorded on the website.  In a random manner, the responses are
    collected into batches of seven, and the seven creators of those responses are
    given the chance to put them in order from best to worst.  The website takes that
    input and processes it to identify the best of those seven.</li>
<li><h3>How do I earn bitcoin without spending any?</h3>
    <ul><li>Choose a prompt that you think will inspire many people and click it.</li>
    <li>Create an answer to the prompt that will be judged as better than others and
        enter it in along with your email address and a bitcoin address.</li>
    <li>The next step is for someone (could be you, but then you'd be "spending"
    bitcoin) to back your answer.</li>
    <li>When enough other answers are available and backed,
    you'll get an email listing your prompt along with six others and a link you can use
    to re-arrange them from best to worst.</li>
    </ul>
    The same email goes to the other 6 people, and
    hopefully many of them will like your answer.  Once the contest is decided,
    some bitcoin will be deposited into the address you entered as a reward for
    providing an answer that inspired someone to back it.</li>
<li><h3>What if I'm willing to risk some bitcoin?</h3>
    Click one of the prompts and you will see a list of answers to it, each one
    with a Reserve button next to it.  Reserving an answer guarantees that any
    bitcoin you send us to back it will be allocated to that answer.  After you hit
    the Reserve button, you'll see a notice indicating what the last
    four digits of the amount you send in must be.<br/><br/>
    Before (and also after) you click teh Reserve button, you'll see a notice
    about backing the prompt itself.  That's right, you can also invest in the prompt itself,
    rather than any of its answers,
    and this is where half of the deducted percentage goes.  The other half is divided between the
    people who created the responses <em>if they also provided a bitcoin address</em>.
    That's how this game pays bitcoin for thinking (and being aware of what people will like).
<li><h3>How do you win?</h3>
    The system provides a random order to be used if the creator doesn't change it before the deadline
    (currently 24 hours after the email is sent). &nbsp;With the seven lists from those creators, the
    system computes a winner and 90% of the bitcoin backing the responses
    is paid right back out to the backers as follows:<br>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>The backing for the 7th place response goes to those who backed on the other 6 places,
        split up proportionally according to how much they put in.</li>
        <li>Likewise, the backing for 6th place is split up among those who backed the other 5 places.</li>
        <li>5th place's backing goes to those who backed 4th.</li>
        <li>4th's goes to 3rd.</li>
        <li>3rd's goes to 2nd.</li>
        <li>2nd's goes to 1st.</li>
        <li>1st's gets their bitcoin back.</li></ul>
    Those who backed first place thus get a piece of all the backing behind all the other places,
    plus they receive back what they put behind the winning response.
<li><h3>If someone earns a very small amount, how do you cover the transaction fee?</h3>
    We won't send bitcoin to an address until we owe that address more than 0.01 BTC.
    The same address must be used to earn more bitcoins in order to avoid spending all
    your earnings on transaction fees.</li>
<li><h3>Is there a minimum acceptable backing amount?</h3>
    There is no minimum backing at this time, but we don't issue payouts for amounts that are
    less than 0.01 BTC.
    </li>
<li><h3>Won't the creators of entries just put their own creation in first place?</h3>
    We assume that most
    response creators will put their own response first, so that doesn't really help
    sort out the best meme.  However, they will also be sorting the other six memes, which
    does help.</li>
