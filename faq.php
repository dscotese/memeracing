<li><h3>What keeps MemeRacing Accountable?</h3>
	If you visit <a target='bcwindow' href='https://blockchain.info/address/1CyuAfo4r6KzspipMoXkN8ReaKf797QrPW'>
	blockchain.info</a>	(or use any tool that will list Bitcoin transactions
	for a particular address),
	you will be able to see all backing both for prompts and for responses.  They are coded
	using the last four digits of the incoming amount.  The last two digits identify the
	prompt.  If the two digits preceding them are both zero, then the amount is from an investor
	who will receive part of the income stream.  If they are not zero, then they identify
	the response the incoming bitcoin is backing.<br/><br/>
	Let's take an example.  In <a target='bcwindow' href='https://blockchain.info/tx/66fcc797f3d2e6ddccacab7e65de4740487254253c7079864781037d66d034cb'>
	this transaction</a>, the prompt code is 05, but the preceding two digits are 04, indicating that this 0.01000405BTC
	is backing one of the responses to the prompt.  However, in <a target='bcwindow' href='https://blockchain.info/tx/6db71d88e7dd6e029bd4a35e383a7503a01b0545c6074231d6acde2c25372d97'>
	this one</a>, those two digits are 00, indicating an investor (it was me) has bought future revenue
	from this prompt.<br/><br/>
	Thus, you can identify all the backing for a given prompt and all the backing
	for each of its responses.  When at least ten responses to a prompt have backing,
	there should be a contest (and then another every time seven more responses get
	backing). At the time of this writing, the prompt with code 05 is the
	<a href='proposal/2'>"dog food"</a> prompt, which has zero contests and six backed
	entries.<br/><br/>
	If you look at the list of prompts, you can see which prompts have the correct number
	of contests, and check each	one to see if the code matches what you see in the transaction.
	When you click a prompt, the page for it will show you the code for that prompt.  This code
	never changes until better prompts come along that push it off the list (of 99).
	Although there are only 99 possible values for the prompt identifier codes, MemeRacing
	supports more than 99 prompts, pushing old, unused prompts off the list when new ones
	come in.  If the prompt has backing and isn't too old, the chances that it has been pushed
	off are very low.<br/><br/>
	If there are more than nine backed responses to a prompt, the list of prompts will indicate
	on the right side that it has at least one
	contest, and when you click that prompt, the contest will be shown at the bottom.  If the
	deadline has passed for voting, then the results will be available with another click.
	At this point in time,
	manual intervention is required for the payouts to be propagated to the blockchain, but that
	will eventually be automated and should take no more than a day.
<li><h3>What's a meme?</h3>
    A meme is like a gene because it gets reproduced and during reproduction it gets modified,
    sometimes getting better and sometimes worse.  Every idea or concept is a meme.</li>
<li><h3>What is a meme race?</h3>
    Here at the MemeRacing site, a meme race is an initial inspirational prompt and all the
    responses that are recorded on the website.  In a random manner, the responses are
    collected into batches of seven, and the seven respondents are
    given the chance to put them in order from best to worst.  The website takes that
    input and processes it to identify the best of those seven.</li>
<li><h3>Why aren't the prompts listed alphabetically like the answers?</h3>
	The prompts that have no backing are listed alphabetically.  They are ordered first by the
	amount of backing they have, and then alphabetically.  If you'd like to see a prompt higher
	in the list, back it!  The prompt with the most backing is always at the top, and then the
	one with the second most, then the third, etc., all the way on down to those with no backing.
</li>
<li><h3>How do I earn bitcoin without spending any?</h3>
    <ul><li>Choose a prompt that you think will inspire many people and click it.</li>
    <li>Create an answer to the prompt that will be judged as better than others and
        enter it in along with your email address and a bitcoin address.</li>
    <li>The next step is for someone (could be you, but then you'd be "spending"
    bitcoin) to back your answer.</li>
    <li>When enough other answers are available and backed,
    you'll get an email listing your answer along with six others and a link you can use
    to re-arrange them from best to worst.</li>
    </ul>
    The same email goes to the other 6 people, and
    hopefully many of them will like your answer.  Once the contest is decided,
    some bitcoin will be deposited into the address you entered as a reward for
    providing an answer that inspired someone to back it.  It is 0.7142857% of the
    total amount of bitcoin that backed all the answers in that contest.</li>
<li><h3>What if I'm willing to risk some bitcoin?</h3>
    Click one of the prompts and you will see a list of answers to it, each one
    with a Reserve button next to it.  Reserving an answer guarantees that any
    bitcoin you send us to back it will be allocated to that answer (as long as you
    set the last four digits of the BTC amount correctly).  After you hit
    the Reserve button, you'll see a notice indicating what the last
    four digits of the amount you send in must be.<br/><br/>
    Before (and also after) you click the Reserve button, you'll see a notice
    about backing the prompt itself.  That's right, you can also invest in the prompt itself,
    rather than any of its answers,
    and this is where 5% of the total amount of bitcoin that backed all the answers in that contest.
    Another five percent is divided between the
    people who created the answers <em>if they also provided a bitcoin address</em>.
    That's how this game pays bitcoin for thinking (and being aware of what people will like).
<li><h3>How do you win?</h3>
    When the number of backed responses that aren't in a contest reaches 10, a random seven
    are chosen and the seven respondents that created them receive an email.  Each respondent
    gets a chance to order all seven answers.  The system provides
    an individualized random order for anyone who doesn't vote before the deadline
    (currently 24 hours after the email is sent). &nbsp;With the seven lists from those seven respondents, the
    system computes a winner and 90% of the bitcoin backing the responses
    is paid right back out to the backers as follows:<br>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>The backing for the 7th place response goes to those who backed on the other 6 places,
        split up proportionally according to how much they put in.</li>
        <li>Likewise, the backing for 6th place is split up among those who backed the other 5 places.</li>
        <li>5th place's backing goes to those who backed the better four.</li>
        <li>4th's goes to backers of the better three.</li>
        <li>3rd's to the backers of the better two.</li>
        <li>2nd's and 1st's all goes to the backers of 1st place.</li></ul>
    Those who backed first place thus get a piece of all the backing behind all the other places,
    plus they receive back what they put behind the winning response.
<li><h3>If someone earns a very small amount, how do you cover the transaction fee?</h3>
    We won't send bitcoin to an address until we owe that address more than 0.001 BTC.
    The same address must be used to earn more bitcoins in order to avoid spending all
    your earnings on transaction fees.</li>
<li><h3>Is there a minimum acceptable backing amount?</h3>
    There is no minimum backing at this time, but we don't issue payouts for amounts that are
    less than 0.001 BTC.
    </li>
<li><h3>Won't the respondents just put their own answer in first place?</h3>
    We assume that most
    respondents will put their own response first, so that doesn't really help
    sort out the best meme.  However, they will also be sorting the other six memes, which
    does help.</li>
