<li><h3>What's a meme?</h3>
    A meme is like a gene because it gets reproduced and during reproduction it gets modified,
    sometimes getting better and sometimes worse.  It's an idea or concept.</li>
<li><h3>What is a meme race?</h3>
    Here at the MemeRacing site, a meme race is an initial inspirational prompt and all the
    responses that are recorded on the website.  In a random manner, the responses are
    collected into batches of seven, and the seven creators of those responses are
    given the chance to put them in order from best to worst.  The website takes that
    input and processes it to identify the best of those seven.</li>
<li><h3>How do I earn bitcoin without spending any?</h3>
    <ul><li>Choose a prompt that you think will inspire many people and click it.</li>
    <li>Create an answer to the prompt that will be judged as better than others and
        enter it in along with your email address and a bitcoin address.</li>
    <li>The next step is for someone (could be you, but then you'd be "spending"
    bitcoin) to back your answer.</li>
    <li>When enough other answers are available and backed,
    you'll get an email listing your prompt along with six others and a link you can use
    to re-arrange them from best to worst.</li>
    </ul>
    The same email goes to the other 6 people, and
    hopefully many of them will like your answer.  Once the contest is decided,
    some bitcoin will be deposited into the address you entered as a reward for
    providing an answer that inspired someone to back it.</li>
<li><h3>If someone earns a very small amount, how do you cover the transaction fee?</h3>
    We won't send bitcoin to an address until we owe that address more than 0.01 BTC.
    The same address must be used to earn more bitcoins in order to avoid spending all
    your earnings on transaction fees.</li>
<li><h3>Is there a minimum acceptable backing amount?</h3>
    There is no minimum backing at this time, but we don't issue payouts for amounts that are
    less than 0.01 BTC.
    </li>
<li><h3>Won't the creators of entries just put their own creation in first place?</h3>
    We assume that most
    response creators will put their own response first, so that doesn't really help
    sort out the best meme.  However, they will also be sorting the other six memes, which
    does help.</li>
